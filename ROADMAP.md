# PomodoroJam — Product Roadmap

> Vision: Transform PomodoroJam from a shared timer into a focus social network —
> where sessions become rooms, productivity becomes identity, and your streak with
> a friend is worth sharing.
>
> Strategy: One feature per day, committed daily. Ship small, ship often.

## Phase 1 — Rooms + Foundation Polish
> Make what exists feel intentional before adding anything new.

### 1a. Sessions → Rooms (UI rename + default names)
- [ ] Rename every "session" label in the UI to "room"
- [ ] Default room name generated on creation (e.g. "Minitjain's Room") — user can customize
- [ ] Room name shown prominently in: explore page, session header, share card, browser tab
- [ ] Files to touch: `app/api/session/route.ts`, `components/session/SessionProvider.tsx`, `app/explore/page.tsx`, `components/landing/LandingClient.tsx`

### 1b. Public / Private toggle
- [ ] Public = shows on explore; Private = invite link only (replaces solo mode for privacy)
- [ ] DB migration: `ALTER TABLE sessions ADD COLUMN is_public boolean DEFAULT true`
- [ ] Toggle shown on room creation and in room settings
- [ ] Skip max participants — not needed yet

### 1c. Avatar upload
- [ ] Create Supabase Storage bucket: `avatars` (public read, authenticated write)
- [ ] Add photo picker + upload to `EditProfileModal`
- [ ] Show upload progress, error state, and preview before saving
- [ ] On save: upload file → get public URL → update `profiles.avatar_url`
- [ ] Avatar renders across: profile page, session participant list, explore page

### 1d. Session tags — what are you working on?
- [ ] Tag picker on room creation: DSA, System Design, Coding, Reading, Writing, Study, Work, Other
- [ ] Tags stored in `sessions.settings` jsonb (no new column needed)
- [ ] Tag shown on explore page card and session header
- [ ] Tags feed into analytics — break down pomodoros by category on profile
- [ ] Makes the duo card richer: "You and @friend spent 3 hours on DSA together"

### 1e. Daily focus goal
- [ ] User sets a daily goal: X pomodoros per day (stored in `profiles.settings` jsonb)
- [ ] Progress ring visible on the session screen — "3 of 6 today"
- [ ] Progress shown on profile page alongside streak
- [ ] Goal resets at midnight, contributes to streak if met

### 1f. Pomodoro counter + long break logic
- [ ] Visual dot indicator on timer: `● ● ● ○` showing current pomodoro in cycle (default 4)
- [ ] Auto-trigger long break (default 15 min) after N pomodoros — standard Pomodoro technique
- [ ] Cycle count shown in session header and recap screen
- [ ] Synced across host + all watchers via broadcast

### 1g. Custom timer presets
- [ ] Preset picker on room creation: Classic (25/5), Deep Work (50/10), Sprint (90/20), Custom
- [ ] Custom lets host set focus/short-break/long-break durations and cycle length
- [ ] Preset shown on explore card and session header
- [ ] Stored in `sessions.settings` jsonb (no new column needed)

### 1h. Invite system
- [ ] Host can invite specific users by username — sends in-app notification: "@host invited you to their room"
- [ ] Room invite link includes preview: room name, tag, who's in it, timer state, participant count
- [ ] "Pending invites" badge in header; inbox at `/invites`
- [ ] DB: `room_invites (id, room_id, inviter_id, invitee_id, status, created_at)` — status: pending/accepted/declined
- [ ] RLS: invitee can read/update their own invites; inviter can read invites they sent

### 1i. Task list in session
- [ ] Before starting, host sets 1–5 tasks: "What are you working on?"
- [ ] Tasks shown as checklist on the session screen for all participants
- [ ] Check off tasks mid-session; completed tasks visible in recap
- [ ] Stored in `sessions.settings` jsonb; updates broadcast to watchers in real-time
- [ ] Feeds session recap screen: "Completed 3 of 4 tasks"

---

## Phase 2 — Social Graph
> Unlocks all engagement features. Build after Phase 1 is solid.

### 2a. User search / discovery
- [ ] Search bar at `/explore` and in the header: search by username or display name
- [ ] Results show: avatar, username, follower count, current streak, "Follow" button
- [ ] Server-side query: `profiles WHERE username ILIKE '%query%' OR display_name ILIKE '%query%'`
- [ ] Debounced input (300ms) — no search button needed
- [ ] Empty state: "No users found. Invite a friend instead → [copy link]"
- [ ] This must ship before follow/unfollow — a social graph with no discovery is useless

### 2b. Follow / Unfollow
- [ ] New table: `followers (follower_id uuid, following_id uuid, created_at timestamptz, PRIMARY KEY (follower_id, following_id))`
- [ ] RLS: anyone can read follows, only you can insert/delete your own
- [ ] Follow / Unfollow button on any profile you don't own
- [ ] Follower count + Following count shown on profile card
- [ ] Following list page: `/profile/[username]/following`
- [ ] Followers list page: `/profile/[username]/followers`

### 2c. Live status on profiles
- [ ] If a user is in a public room right now → show "🔴 Live" badge on their profile
- [ ] Clicking it shows: room name + tag + participant count + "Join room" button
- [ ] Implementation: query `sessions` where `host_id = profile.id AND running = true AND is_public = true AND last_active_at > 90s ago`
- [ ] Profile page revalidates every 30s

### 2d. Friends' rooms on Explore
- [ ] Explore page gets two tabs: "Friends" and "Everyone"
- [ ] Friends tab: rooms where at least one person you follow is currently active
- [ ] Everyone tab: current explore behavior (all public rooms)
- [ ] Requires auth to see Friends tab — guests see Everyone only

### 2e. "Friend started a room" notification banner
- [ ] When someone you follow starts a public room → in-app banner appears: "@friend just started a room — join them?"
- [ ] Banner auto-dismisses after 8s, click goes directly to the room
- [ ] Implementation: Supabase Realtime subscription on `sessions` INSERT where `host_id IN (following list)`
- [ ] This is the pull mechanic Forest literally cannot build — our biggest weapon

### 2f. Session recap screen
- [ ] After a focus session ends: full-screen recap overlay
- [ ] Shows: total time focused, pomodoros completed, logs added, who was in the room, tag, tasks completed
- [ ] One-tap share via Web Share API
- [ ] "See you tomorrow" with current streak shown — reinforces daily habit
- [ ] **Guest conversion nudge**: if user is not signed in, show "Save your streak — create an account" as the primary CTA on this screen. Highest-intent moment in the entire app — never waste it.

### 2g. Room reactions
- [ ] Emoji reaction bar on session screen: 🔥 💪 😤 ☕ — one tap, no typing
- [ ] Reactions float up and disappear (CSS animation) — visible to all participants via broadcast
- [ ] Doesn't interrupt focus; no chat, no replies — reactions only
- [ ] Rate-limited: max 1 reaction per user per 10s

### 2h. Accountability buddy mode
- [ ] Pair with one specific user: mutual opt-in, both must accept
- [ ] If either misses a focus day → the other gets an in-app nudge: "@friend hasn't focused today — send them a push?"
- [ ] Shared streak shown on both profiles: "14-day streak with @friend"
- [ ] DB: `accountability_pairs (user_a uuid, user_b uuid, created_at, PRIMARY KEY (user_a, user_b))`
- [ ] Max 1 buddy per user to keep it meaningful

---

## Phase 2.5 — Integrations
> Distribution channels and personality signals. Discord alone is worth a phase.

### 2.5a. Discord OAuth login
- [ ] Add Discord as a Supabase auth provider (OAuth 2.0)
- [ ] On first Discord login: pre-fill display name + avatar from Discord profile
- [ ] Show Discord icon on profile if connected
- [ ] Link existing account to Discord in profile settings

### 2.5b. Discord Rich Presence
- [ ] When user is in an active room → broadcast to Discord: "Focusing · Deep Work · 18:34 remaining"
- [ ] Room name + tag shown as activity details; participant count as state
- [ ] Implementation: Discord Game SDK / `discord-rpc` via a lightweight Electron wrapper or browser extension
- [ ] Passive distribution — every Discord user who sees it is a potential new user
- [ ] Opt-in toggle in profile settings (default ON for Discord-connected users)

### 2.5c. Discord bot
- [ ] `/start-room` — creates a room and posts the invite link in the channel
- [ ] `/focus-status` — shows who from the server is currently in a room
- [ ] Scheduled room reminder: bot posts "Room starting in 10 minutes — join @host" in a configured channel
- [ ] Invite via: `discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize` with bot scope

### 2.5d. Spotify now playing
- [ ] Spotify OAuth in profile settings (scopes: `user-read-currently-playing`, `user-read-playback-state`)
- [ ] If connected + in a room: show track name + artist + album art in a small pill on the session screen
- [ ] Other participants see your "now playing" in real-time (broadcast via presence metadata)
- [ ] "Top tracks during focus" section on profile: most played songs/artists during logged sessions
- [ ] Opt-in; can hide per-session

### 2.5e. Apple Music + Last.fm
- [ ] Apple Music: MusicKit JS — same display as Spotify, no OAuth needed on supported browsers
- [ ] Last.fm: scrobble completed pomodoro sessions as listening sessions; show "scrobbled X tracks this session"
- [ ] Both shown as optional connections in profile settings alongside Spotify

### 2.5f. PWA — installable app
- [ ] `manifest.json`: name, icons (192/512), theme color, `display: standalone`, `start_url`
- [ ] Service worker: cache shell + static assets; timer keeps running offline (already clock-based)
- [ ] "Add to Home Screen" install prompt triggered after first completed pomodoro
- [ ] Push notifications via Web Push API (replaces Notification API for installed users)
- [ ] iOS Safari: `apple-touch-icon` + `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tags

---

## Phase 3 — Gamification + Shared Stats
> The viral, sticky layer. Build after Phase 2 is solid.

### 3a. Shared focus stats between two users
- [ ] Query: pomodoro_logs where both user A and user B have entries for the same session_id
- [ ] Surface on profiles: "You and @friend have focused together X times — Y minutes total"
- [ ] Tag breakdown: "3 hours on DSA, 2 hours on System Design"
- [ ] Only show this section when viewing someone else's profile (not your own)
- [ ] Shared streak: consecutive days both users completed at least one room together

### 3b. Solo shareable card (extends existing /api/og)
- [ ] New card variant: `type=stats` — total pomodoros, streak, focus hours, heatmap preview
- [ ] One-tap share via Web Share API (navigator.share) → Instagram Stories, WhatsApp, iMessage
- [ ] Fallback: copy image URL to clipboard (already partially built in ProfileCard)
- [ ] Files: `app/api/og/route.tsx` (add stats variant), `components/profile/ProfileCard.tsx`

### 3c. Duo shareable card
- [ ] New OG variant: `type=duo` — both avatars flanking a bonfire, "50 rooms together, 1,247 minutes"
- [ ] Shared streak + shared log count displayed
- [ ] Only generates if both users have at least 1 shared session
- [ ] Share button appears on the "shared stats" section of the profile
- [ ] This is the screenshot people send to friends — the viral hook

### 3d. Milestone toasts in-session
- [ ] When a room completes, check if host + any participant hit a milestone together
- [ ] Milestones: 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 rooms together
- [ ] Show a celebration toast inside the session: "You and @friend just hit 50 rooms together!"
- [ ] Milestone data stored in: query on the fly from pomodoro_logs (no new table needed)

---

## Phase 4 — The Bonfire (Visual Soul)
> Our answer to Forest's growing tree — but inherently multiplayer.
> A fire gets bigger when people gather around it. No explanation needed.

### 4a. Bonfire on the session screen
- [ ] Three.js WebGL particle system — CSS fire looks predictable, Three.js fire breathes
- [ ] Dynamic import only on session page: `dynamic(() => import('@/components/session/BonfireScene'), { ssr: false })` — landing page unaffected
- [ ] Two particle tiers: desktop 400+ particles (embers + smoke), mobile 150 particles (no smoke)
- [ ] Point light from the fire that softly illuminates the session UI around it
- [ ] Flame states tied to session:
  - Session starts → small flame ignites from nothing
  - Focus timer running → flames grow steadily
  - Pomodoro completed → log added, flames surge briefly then settle
  - Break time → flames calm to a gentle glow
  - Timer paused → flames shrink slowly
  - Session abandoned mid-focus → fire dies → ashes

### 4b. Logs as pomodoro completions
- [ ] Each completed pomodoro = one wooden log added to the 3D pile
- [ ] Logs are physically countable — pile grows visibly over the session
- [ ] Log count shown in session header: "4 logs"
- [ ] Uses `pomodoro_logs` table (already exists — no new table needed)

### 4c. Shared bonfire in rooms
- [ ] Everyone feeds the same fire — one bonfire, not one per person
- [ ] Flame height scales with active participant count
- [ ] When someone joins → fire visibly grows; when someone leaves → flame dips
- [ ] Shared fire is the social metaphor built into the mechanic

### 4d. Tab-switch accountability
- [ ] Page Visibility API: when tab loses focus mid-focus-timer, fire starts shrinking
- [ ] Come back within 30s → fire recovers fully
- [ ] Stay away → fire shrinks to embers, then ashes
- [ ] This is the "skin in the game" mechanic — abandoning the tab has a consequence
- [ ] In shared rooms: only affects your personal contribution, not the whole fire

### 4e. Ashes state
- [ ] Fire dies → particles physics-settle into ash pile on the ground
- [ ] Ashes screen shown to all participants when host abandons mid-session
- [ ] Must feel bad enough to see that users avoid it (same psychological weight as Forest's dead tree)

### 4f. Bonfire on the duo shareable card
- [ ] Both avatars flanking a rendered bonfire snapshot
- [ ] "50 sessions together — 1,247 minutes. 237 logs added."
- [ ] Bonfire size reflects total shared sessions (bigger fire = more history together)

---

## Phase 5 — Retention + Onboarding
> Makes the app sticky for new users who have zero friends on it yet.

### 5a. Onboarding flow
- [ ] First-time visitor sees a 3-step onboarding: what is PomodoroJam, how rooms work, the bonfire mechanic
- [ ] "Aha moment" designed in: show a live room with the fire burning before they even sign up
- [ ] Skip-friendly — should never feel forced
- [ ] After sign-up: prompt to follow 1-2 suggested users (seeded accounts that are always "active")

### 5b. Cold start fallback — global community feel
- [ ] When user has 0 follows, show "X people are focusing right now worldwide" on the session screen
- [ ] Small subtle bonfire silhouettes in the background on explore when there are no rooms (instead of empty state text)
- [ ] "No friends yet? Start a room and share the link" CTA instead of dead empty state

### 5c. Scheduled rooms
- [ ] Host can schedule a room for a future time: "Study session tonight at 9pm"
- [ ] Room appears on explore with a countdown: "Starts in 2h 14m — 3 committed"
- [ ] Follow users get a banner notification when a scheduled room they committed to is about to start
- [ ] DB: `sessions.scheduled_at timestamptz`, `sessions.committed_user_ids uuid[]`

### 5d. Streak surfaced prominently
- [ ] Current streak shown on the session screen itself (not just profile) — small badge
- [ ] "Day 7 streak — don't break it" shown at session end recap
- [ ] At-risk warning: if user hasn't focused today and it's past 8pm — banner on landing page

---

## Phase 6 — Reliability + Infrastructure
> Not glamorous. Absolutely necessary before any real user growth.

### 6a. Offline / Realtime error state on session screen
- [ ] Detect Supabase Realtime disconnect mid-session
- [ ] Show a non-intrusive "Reconnecting..." banner — timer keeps running locally (clock-based, so it still works)
- [ ] On reconnect: re-sync state silently, dismiss banner
- [ ] On failure after 15s: show "Connection lost — your timer is still running locally" — don't freeze the UI

### 6b. Room history
- [ ] "Recent rooms" section on the profile page — last 10 rooms the user was in
- [ ] Shows: room name, tag, date, duration, who else was there
- [ ] Query from `pomodoro_logs` joined with `sessions` — no new table needed
- [ ] Links back to the room (even if it's ended, show a read-only recap)

### 6c. Weekly stats email digest
- [ ] Every Monday morning: "Your focus week in review"
- [ ] Contents: total pomodoros, focus hours, streak status, tag breakdown, one friend's stats
- [ ] "This week: 14 pomodoros. @friend did 22. Don't let them pull ahead."
- [ ] Implementation: Supabase Edge Function on a cron schedule + Resend (free tier covers this)
- [ ] Opt-out in profile settings — default ON for signed-in users
- [ ] This is the retention touchpoint Forest doesn't have. Weekly email = weekly re-engagement.

### 6d. Mobile layout audit
- [ ] Full audit of session screen on 375px (iPhone SE) and 390px (iPhone 14)
- [ ] Bonfire + timer + controls must all fit without scrolling
- [ ] Participant list collapses gracefully at small sizes
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44px (Apple HIG)
- [ ] Do this before Phase 4 ships, not after

## What NOT to Build (Scope Boundaries)

| Feature | Why not |
|---------|---------|
| Direct messaging | Different product. Adds moderation burden. |
| Leaderboards | Needs critical mass first. Adds pressure, not joy. |
| Push notifications (mobile) | Complex infra. Save for when there's a native app. |
| Paid tiers / subscriptions | Premature. Build the social graph first. |
| AI focus suggestions | Feature creep. The product is the people, not the AI. |
| Max participants cap | Not needed at current scale. Revisit at 1k DAU. |
| Coin/reward economy | Too complex. Logs are the reward — they're visible and real. |

-- Phase 5c
ALTER TABLE public.sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS scheduled_at timestamptz DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE public.sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS committed_user_ids uuid[] DEFAULT '{}';

-- Supabase Storage (run in dashboard or via CLI)
-- INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true);
-- CREATE POLICY "Public avatar read"  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
-- CREATE POLICY "Auth avatar upload"  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
-- CREATE POLICY "Auth avatar update"  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

## The One Thing That Will Make or Break This

**The bonfire duo shareable card.**

Two avatars flanking a roaring fire. "50 sessions together — 1,247 minutes. 237 logs added."
One tap to share to Instagram Stories, WhatsApp, or iMessage.

That is the screenshot people send to friends. That is the viral loop.
Forest has a tree. We have a fire you build together — and that's a better story.

Everything else is infrastructure. The bonfire card is the hook.
